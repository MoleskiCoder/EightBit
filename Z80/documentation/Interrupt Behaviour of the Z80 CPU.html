<h1> Interrupt Behaviour of the Z80 CPU</h1>
<p><i>by Achim Flammenkamp</i></p>

<h2>Interrupt timing</h2>
Only at the end of an instruction execution, except a NOP in case HALT, a LDD in case LDDR, a OUTI in case OTIR, etc., the CPU checks for an interrupt request.
Thus the INT-pin should be active for at least 23 clock ticks because some IX
resp. IY instruction last so long.
Now an interrupt is accepted if INT-pin is low(active) and the interrupt flip flop
IFF1 is set or the NMI-pin is respectively was active during the just performed instruction.
If this is the case, the following happens:<br>

Immediately IFF1 is reset to 0 and if INT-pin is low also IFF2 is reset to 0.
Then the behavior depends whether it is a non maskable interrupt (NMI) or a
maskable interrupt (INT). In the later case the interrupt mode (IM) of the CPU is
also decisive:
<ul>
<li>NMI<br>
It takes 11 clock cycles to get to #0066:
<ol>
  <li> M1 cycle: 5 T states to do an opcode read and decrement SP
  </li><li> M2 cycle: 3 T states write high byte of PC to the stack and decrement SP
  </li><li> M3 cycle: 3 T states write the low byte of PC and jump to #0066.
</li></ol>   
</li><li>INT and interrupt mode 0 set<br>
In this mode, timing depends on the instruction put on the bus.
The interrupt processing last 2 clock cycles more
than this instruction usually needs.<br>
Two typical examples follow:<br>
<ol>
a RST n on the data bus, it takes 13 cycles to get to 'n':
<li> M1 cycle: 7 ticks<br>acknowledge interrupt and decrement SP
</li><li> M2 cycle: 3 ticks<br>write high byte and decrement SP
</li><li> M3 cycle: 3 ticks<br>write low byte and jump to 'n' 
</li></ol>

<ol>
With a CALL nnnn on the data bus, it takes 19 cycles:
<li> M1 cycle: 7 ticks<br>acknowledge interrupt
</li><li> M2 cycle: 3 ticks<br>read low byte of 'nnnn' from data bus
</li><li> M3 cycle: 3 ticks<br>read high byte of 'nnnn' and decrement SP
</li><li> M4 cycle: 3 ticks<br>write high byte of PC to the stack and decrement SP
</li><li> M5 cycle: 3 ticks<br>write low byte of PC and jump to 'nnnn'. 
</li></ol>
</li><li>INT and interrupt mode 1 set<br>
It takes 13 clock cycles to reach #0038:
<ol>
 <li> M1 cycle: 7 ticks<br>
 acknowledge interrupt and decrement SP
 </li><li> M2 cycle: 3 ticks<br>
 write high byte of PC onto the stack and decrement SP
 </li><li> M3 cycle: 3 ticks<br>
 write low byte onto the stack and to set PC to #0038.
</li></ol>
</li><li>INT and interrupt mode 2 set<br>
It takes 19 clock cycles to get to the interrupt routine:
<ol>
 <li> M1 cycle: 7 ticks<br>
 acknowledge interrupt and decrement SP
 </li><li> M2 cycle: 3 ticks<br>
 write high byte of PC onto stack and decrement SP
 </li><li> M3 cycle: 3 ticks<br>
 write low byte onto the stack
 </li><li> M4 cycle: 3 ticks<br>
 read low byte from the interrupt vector
 </li><li> M5 cycle: 3 ticks<br>
 read high byte from bus and jump to interrupt routine 
</li></ol></li></ul>
Some remarks:
<ol>
<li> "acknowledge interrupt" means pin IORQ gets together with M1-pin
active/low. Furthermore the CPU adds 2 wait states to the normal machine cycle.
</li><li>Quoted remark<em>:
<ul>
<li>If a LD A,I or LD A,R (which copy IFF2
to the P/V flag) is interrupted, then the P/V flag is reset, even if
interrupts were enabled beforehand.
</li><li>If interrupts are disabled when a EI instruction is
interrupted, then the interrupt will not occur until after the
instruction following the EI, as when IFF1 is sampled
during the one and only machine-cycle of the EI, it will be reset.
</li></ul>
</em>

</li><li>An INT will let the INT-pin low(active) until it is indirectly
reseted by an RETI or other external hardware. In contrast a signal
at the NMI-pin will be recognized when its state going from high to low!
Thus it is not a level trigger signal, but a pulse which is stored internally
by the CPU until the next M1 cycle.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><h2>Reset Timing</h2>
One can consider a reset (RESET-pin gets low) as a very special interrupt.
If this occurs, the following happens in one machine cycle:<br>
<ul>
It takes 3 clock cycles:
<li>IFF1 and IFF2 as well as interrupt mode is set to 0
</li><li>PC is set to 0, I and R registers are reset also.
</li><li>SP is set to 0xffff as well as the A and the F register is set to 0xff.
</li></ul>
